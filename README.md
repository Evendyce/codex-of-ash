# codex-of-ash-and-echoes

---

> **Codex of Ash & Echoes** is a world-bible rendered as a lightweight, searchable website.
>
> * **Content-first:** Write lore in Markdown/MDX; cross-link eras, terms, and artifacts.
> * **Searchable:** Pagefind powers instant, client-side search—no servers needed.
> * **Readable:** Deep links, hover glossaries, and “On this page” navigation keep heavy lore approachable.
>   The setting spans the Golden Age, the Descent into Despair, the Last Genius’s Cataclysm, the Ashen Recovery, and the trembling Present—where quakes ripple from the world’s Scar and Aetherborn scouts test the veil.
